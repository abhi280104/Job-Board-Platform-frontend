# Job Board Platform

🚀 **Live Demo:** [Job Board Platform](https://job-board-platform-frontend-ecru.vercel.app/)  

## 📌 Overview  
This is a **Job Board Platform** where users can browse job listings and apply for jobs. Since this project focuses only on the **frontend**, mock data is used for job listings and user authentication.

## 🎨 Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion   
- **Deployment:** Vercel  

## 🔥 Features  
✅ Homepage displaying job listings   
✅ Search and filter functionality   
✅ Authentication (using mock data)  
✅ Pagination for job listings  

## 🗂️ Data Source  
Since no backend is implemented, **dummy data** is used:  
- `jobsDummyData.js` (Located in `/data` folder) - Contains job listings  
- `usersDummyData.js` (Located in `/data` folder) - Contains test users  

📌 **Note:**  
- If a job is added from the **Admin Dashboard**, it will **not** be reflected on the user side because the data is static. Since this project is frontend-only, job listings do not persist and remain unchanged.
